You can modify values here, but you must be really familiar with partition
management to do this.

Buttons #1..#4 will switch editor window to 1st sector of appropriate

.topic HelpCont=2068
 About ‹
  ﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂ
QSINIT is a some kind of boot loader ;) Basically it load OS/2 kernel ;),
but suitable for many other things - like playing tetris or implementing
boot time disk editor.

Common idea of it is creating a small 32 bit protected mode environment
with runtime and module execution support. It looks like old good DOS/4GW
apps, but without DOS at all.

This application is basically self-explaining.

To get help on shell commands - type "help command" or "command /?" in
shell.

Shell invoked by F3 key from boot time menu, or type "cmd" in
{run dialog:RunExecute} in this program.

Full shell command list available by single "help" command.

.topic ViewAsBPB=2070

  ﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂ
Select hard disk here.

QSINIT shows only disks, reported by BIOS.

If your disk (ex. flash drive) is not listed here - it can be 
unsuported by BIOS code or big-floppy formatted.

Big-floppy flash drive still can be mounted from QSINIT command line.

.topic DmgrPart=2075

  ﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂ
Select partition or free space to manage.

.topic DmgrAction=2076
 Partition actions ‹
  ﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂ
This list contain available actions for selected partition:

* "Boot" - boot from this partition. System will hang if no boot code available!

* "Delete" - delete this partition.

* "Format" - format partition to FAT/FAT32 file system.

* "Make active" - make primary partition active. 

For GPT disks this command set "BIOS Bootable" attribute to partition.
I.e. this partition will be booted in "BIOS mode boot", by MBR code of
GPT disk. 

You also need to replace MBR code to provided by QSINIT.

* "Mount" - mount partition to QSINIT drive letter

* "Unmount" - unmount partition from QSINIT

* "LVM drive letter" - set OS/2 LVM drive letter

* "LVM rename" - set OS/2 LVM volume name

* "Set type GUID" - set partition type on GPT disks

* "Clone" - clone partition data to another existing partition.

* "Create logical" - create logical partition on selected free space

* "Create primary" - create primary partition on selected free space

* "Sector view" - go to first sector of this partition in disk editor window.

.topic DmgrDlg=2077
 Disk management ‹
  ﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂ
This dialog allow to manage hard disks and partitions. 

To manage entire disk select disk first, then disk action from action list.

To manage partition - select disk, then partition on it and then action from
partition action list.

.topic DmgrDiskAction=2078
 Disk actions ‹
  ﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂ
This list contain actions on entire disk. Be cafrefully with all of it:

* "Boot" - boot MBR code of this disk

* "Clone" - clone disk structure (and data, optionally). Option available
only if exist empty disk of appropriate size.

* "Init disk" - initialize MBR on empty disk (i.e. prepare it to use).
This action can optionally write LVM signature.

* "Init disk (GPT)" - write GPT partition table to empty disk (GPT is not
supported by OS/2, but QSINIT can operate it).

* "Replace MBR code" - replace MBR code to provided by QSINIT. This code is
compatible with OS/2 boot. Option is available for GPT disks too.

* "Restore MBR backup" - restore partition structure from backup image file. Option
available only when disk is empty, i.e. MBR destroyd (sector have no 55 AA signature).

* "Update LVM info" - update LVM info (option available only if LVM tables on disk
have one or more correctable errors).

* "Save MBR backup" - save partition structure to VHDD image file. This file can
be used to restore it (when MBR will be damaged). File also can be mounted by
VHDD shell command as QSINIT common disk.

* "Wipe disk" - wipe partition table (ENTIRE DISK!)

* "Write LVM info" - write LVM info to non-LVM disk. Option suitable for disks
smaller than 500Gb, have been prepared in other operating system. Partitions on
huge disks should be created in OS/2, DSFEE or QSINIT.

.topic DmgrRescan=2081
 Rescan disks ‹
  ﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂ
Force rescanning of partition table on all disks.

This action is not required by default, but can be used in some rare cases,
like update after manual partition table editing in sector editor.

.topic Calculator=2100
 Calculator ‹
  ﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂ
This calculator operates only by signed 64-bit integer values.

 * ESC - clear
 * "_" - sign change (+/-), decimal mode only
 * "x" - hex/dec view mode
 * "p" - power of
 * "!" - binary not
 * "m" - save to memory
 * "r" - get from memory
 * "%" - mod
 * "<>" - shift to left/right
 * "^|&" - binary xor/or/and
 * "+-/*" - i hope you know ;)

.topic MemEdit=2101
 Edit memory ‹
  ﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂ
View/edit PC memory.

Memory editor operates with 256 byte blocks. When you leave this block
editor will ask for update actual memory.

Note that in non-paging mode QSINIT shows all memory, but below 4Gb only. In
paging mode QSINIT shows all physical memory, but device space at the end of
4th gigabyte is not mapped and unaccessible. This is not so bad, because
walking over it in memory editor can cause deadlocks.

.topic SectGoto=2102
 Disk≥Go to sector ‹    (F11)
  ﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂ
Type physical disk sector number to go to.

Use decimal values or C language hex notation (0xA1B2C3D4).

.topic DskClone=2112
 Disk clone ‹
  ﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂ
Clone disk to any available empty disk.

Options:

* "Clone IDs" - clone all known disk identifiers (serial numbers and so on).

* "Copy MBR code" - copy MBR code from source disk.

* "Identical" - make sector-to-sector copy of source disk partition table
structures (affects MBR only).

* "Ignore CHS mismatch" - ignore "sector per track" value miscmatch on BIOS
level. If LVM info is available on source disk - it can produce CHS mismatch
too, but this case is unavoidable (Disks must be close in size to avoid this).

* "Wipe old data" - (Structure only) wipe partition boot sectors on target disk
after copying. This is required because some old data can be available in it.
Turn this option off if you restoring MBR structure from backup disk to broken
original.

.topic VolClone=2121
 Partition clone ‹
  ﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂ
Clone partition data to any available partition.

Command knows nothing about file systems, it just copies data. If target
partition larger, than source - remaining part will be "lost" - because file
system structures not adjusted to new partition size.

Only one thing updated by copying process - common BPB in boot sector, if it
available.

.topic FileDlgCommon=2124
 Open/Save dialog‹
  ﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂ
To change disk just type A: or B: (and so on) in file name`s edit line.
This is QSINIT internal drive letter, not OS/2.

* A: - boot partition (FAT or FAT32, file i/o on HPFS/JFS is not supported)

* B: - small ram disk with QSINIT apps (contents of QSINIT.LDI archive)

* C:..J: - available to mount (use disk management dialog or MOUNT command)

To go directly to directory - type it path in this line too.
